# Demo Day - Data Exploration - May the Knowledge Graph Be With You

## Getting Started

The data used in the exercise is in the `data` directory. Files provided by stardog are included, the rest can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/star-wars.

You will need these files somewhere handy to use throughout the exercise.

## Getting a Cloud Account

Go to https://cloud.stardog.com and create your account. This is free and is the best way to access the Stardog Platform. 

## Getting a Stardog Environment

You have several options for your Stardog environment for demo day. If you would like to actively participate, you will need your own Stardog instance. The easiest way to do this is to [subscribe to Stardog Cloud](https://cloud.stardog.com/get-started). However you are welcome to [download](https://www.stardog.com/get-started/) and operate the Stardog Platform yourself.

The final result of what we will start building in this exercise is available via Stardog Cloud Express. From the [cloud homepage](https://cloud.stardog.com) press `New Connection` and use the following details:

```
username=anonymous
password=anonymous
endpoint=https://express.stardog.cloud:5820
```

Add unique name like "Stardog Express" for this connection and push the `Connect` button. This will add a connection to Stardog Cloud Express in your Stardog Account. From there you can select this connection, jump into Explorer, and browse the database `star-wars` to see the final product.
