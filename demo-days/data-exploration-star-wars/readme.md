# Demo Day - Data Exploration - May the Knowledge Graph Be With You

## Getting Started

The data used in the exercise is in the `data` directory. Files provided by stardog are included, the rest can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/star-wars.

## Getting a Cloud Account

Go to https://cloud.stardog.com and create your account. This is free and is the best way to access the Stardog Platform. 

## Getting a Stardog Environment

You have several options for your Stardog environment for demo day. If you would like to actively participate, you will need your own Stardog instance. The easiest way to do this is to subscribe to Stardog Cloud, either Free or Essentials, and use that. However you are welcome to download and operate the Stardog Platform yourself.

If you simply want to play with the resulting demo, this is available to all Stardog users from our stock demos.
